- running a lot of commands. i am completely unfamiliar with the commands.
  - i like that it asks me to confirm which commands it wants me to run.
  - do i trust this whole thing?
  - you can toggle a setting to keep it running
  
- deffs can't one shot. even with opus4.6

## ToDo
  
- install .dmg behavior is odd. deleting it from applications doesn't remove it
- stocks panel/tab for greater detail
